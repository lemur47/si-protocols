## Mission

**Spiritual Intelligence** — cybersecurity for the soul and planetary defence.

si-protocols provides open-source tools that detect disinformation patterns in metaphysical and spiritual content. The project operates at the intersection of natural language processing, pattern recognition, and spiritual literacy — giving individuals and communities the means to evaluate the content they consume.

## What Is Spiritual Intelligence?

Spiritual Intelligence (SI / 霊的知能) is the capacity to discern, evaluate, and navigate spiritual and metaphysical information with clarity. It encompasses:

- **Critical discernment** — the ability to distinguish authentic spiritual teaching from manipulative rhetoric
- **Pattern recognition** — identifying recurring disinformation tactics across traditions, cultures, and languages
- **Emotional sovereignty** — maintaining independent judgement when confronted with fear-based or euphoria-driven persuasion
- **Systemic awareness** — understanding how spiritual narratives interact with social, economic, and political systems

SI is not about debunking spirituality. It is about raising the standard of spiritual discourse by making manipulation patterns visible.

## Problem Statement

Spiritual and metaphysical content is uniquely vulnerable to disinformation because:

1. **Emotion-driven persuasion** — spiritual claims often bypass rational evaluation by targeting fear, hope, and identity
2. **Unfalsifiable authority** — appeals to channelled messages, ancient wisdom, or divine revelation resist fact-checking
3. **Escalating commitment** — manipulative content progressively demands greater financial, emotional, and social investment
4. **Covert inter-systemic threats** — deceptive spiritual narratives can serve as vectors for financial exploitation, political radicalisation, and cult recruitment
5. **Cross-cultural exploitation** — the same manipulation patterns appear in English-language New Age content, Japanese スピリチュアル商法, prosperity gospel, and conspirituality movements worldwide

No mainstream content moderation tool addresses these patterns. si-protocols fills that gap.

## Approach

### Technology

- **NLP-based pattern detection** — spaCy pipelines analyse text across seven dimensions: vagueness, authority claims, urgency/fear, emotional manipulation, logical contradictions, source attribution, and commitment escalation
- **Heuristic layer** — probabilistic dissonance scanner (placeholder for future biofeedback integration)
- **Multi-language architecture** — extensible marker registry supports English and Japanese, with a clean path to additional languages
- **Hybrid scoring** — weighted combination of tech and heuristic layers produces a 0–100 threat score

### Principles

- **Open source** — MIT-licenced, fully transparent
- **Local-only** — never hosts, collects, or analyses third-party content
- **Non-judgemental** — detects manipulation patterns without evaluating spiritual beliefs themselves
- **Culturally aware** — markers are adapted to specific spiritual traditions and linguistic contexts, not naively translated

## Audience

- **Researchers** studying spiritual disinformation, cult dynamics, and online radicalisation
- **Content creators** (YouTubers, bloggers, podcasters) who want to evaluate their own content for inadvertent manipulation patterns
- **Spiritual and thought leaders** seeking to maintain integrity in their communications
- **Engineers** interested in the intersection of NLP, spirituality, and information integrity
- **Individuals** navigating the spiritual marketplace who want analytical tools to complement their own discernment

## Roadmap

1. **Multi-language analysis** — Japanese language support (markers, NLP pipeline, CLI, API) ✓
2. **Web demo** — Svelte-based interactive interface for browser-based analysis
3. **note.com launch** — Japanese-language articles and community engagement
4. **Community building** — contributor programme, marker refinement, tradition-specific modules
5. **Consulting and SaaS** — professional services for organisations dealing with spiritual disinformation

## Two-Channel Strategy

- **English channel** — neutral, professional tone. Focused on the technology, research applications, and open-source community. Primary platform: GitHub, project website.
- **Japanese channel** — nerdy, techie tone. Emphasises the engineering craft and Japanese spiritual context (スピリチュアル, 霊感商法, カルト対策). Primary platform: note.com.

Both channels share the same codebase and core technology. The difference is editorial voice, not capability.

## Tone

Professional. Not provocative. Let the technology speak.

si-protocols does not attack spiritual traditions or practitioners. It provides analytical tools. The project's credibility comes from technical rigour, transparent methodology, and respect for the complexity of spiritual experience.
